# Iris_Classification
The application of basic Machine Learning Models and Model Evaluation Metrics to perform classification task with IRIS Dataset.

**The Purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate the application of basic Machine Learning Models and some basic Model Evaluation Metrics to perform classification task with IRIS Dataset**

In this example, Naive Bayes, Random Forest and SVM is used to create an Ensemble Voting Model for the classification task. Feel free to drop a comment and feedback.
